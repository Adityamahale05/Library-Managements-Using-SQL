# Library-Managements-Using-SQL

This project is a beginner-friendly Library Management System built using SQL. It simulates the operations of a typical library, including tracking books, members, borrowing, and returns. The goal is to provide hands-on experience in relational database design, data manipulation, and querying using SQL.

🔍**Key Features**
Manage book inventory with details such as title, author, genre, and availability.
Maintain student/member records.
Track book issues and returns with timestamps.
Implement due date and fine logic (if extended).

**Use SQL queries for insights like:**

Most borrowed books
Active users
Overdue returns
